#### This repository contains examples of implementation of data structures in C.

- [array](https://github.com/crsalves/data-structure/tree/master/array): implementation of array and two dimensional array. 

- [deque](https://github.com/crsalves/data-structure/tree/master/deque): implementation of deque.

- [list](https://github.com/crsalves/data-structure/tree/master/list): implementation of list for binary and sentinel searching. Also, it has linked static, linked circular, linked dynamic, and linear sequential list.

- [queue](https://github.com/crsalves/data-structure/tree/master/queue): implementation of static and dynamic queue.

- [stack](https://github.com/crsalves/data-structure/tree/master/stack): implementation of static, dynamic and double stack.

- [tree](https://github.com/crsalves/data-structure/tree/master/tree): implementation of binary, non-binary, and AVL tree.
